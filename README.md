# Spotify-Playlist-Analysis
Spotify Playlist Exporter is a Python utility that uses the Spotify Web API to fetch all tracks from a playlist, retrieve their IDs and audio features, store them in a local SQLite database, and export the data to CSV. It streamlines playlist analysis, backup, or migration workflows.
